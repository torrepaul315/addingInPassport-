Build a Full Stack app that allows users to CRUD blog posts.

<hr>
# Wait!!!!

Before you rush in, scan this whole document. Soak it in. Take your time.

<hr>
# Think Things Through Thoroughly

These instructions provide a general outline and leave a lot of room for interpretation. They may not list exactly everything you need to do to build this CRUD app.

Be smart, be pragmatic, be excellent to each other.

<hr>
# gBlog Relationships

gBlog consists of the following relationships:

* A website has many blog posts.

* A blog post has a Title (Required), Body (Required), Author Name (Required), and Creation time (Required).

* A blog post can have many comments.

* A comment has a Body (Required), and Author Name (Required) and Creation time (Required).

> Do not worry about authentication and authorization right now. Auth is a stretch goal. Get your blog post CRUD working and UI created FIRST.

<hr>
# Steps for Success

## 1. Think and Diagram FIRST

Create an entity relationship diagram. Do not move on until you have.

## 2. Project Setup

* Get the project directory setup (using the express generator, or from scratch using npm init, npm install etc.).

* Create a new repo on github and prepare it for the initial check in.

* Check in your code

* Take pictures of the entity relationship diagrams and check them in.

## 3. Create the Database and Tables

* Work together to create the database and tables using the entity relationship diagram drawn as a reference.

* You may use your preferred method for creating the database and tables (psql, pg, knex migrations, etc.).

* Check in your code

## 4. CRUD Blog posts

* Create the CRUD routes for blog posts.

* Your routes should only return json.

* Make sure to test a route using postman or ajax requests before moving on to the next route.

* Check in your code

## 5. CRUD Blog comments

* Create the CRUD routes for blog comments.

* Your routes should only return json.

* Make sure to test a route using postman or ajax requests before moving on to the next route.

* Check in your code

## 6. Mock Up

* Draw/Mockup each of the following pages before moving on. Be sure to take pictures of your mockups and store them in your github repo.

* You should have an exact idea of the interaction and navigation that will happen in your app before you write a single line of code.

* The website will consist of the following pages:

+ this equals my inserted tasks!
+ Nav Bar
1- update nav bar across the website make
2- make links work

var excerptArray = blogPostBody.match(/[^?!\.]+[?!\.]+/g);

* Home page:

 * A list of all blog posts sorted by creation time and a 3 sentence excerpt from each.
 + 2 steps remaining!
 1- only showing a 3 sentence excerpt
 2- sorting blog posts by timestamp(come back to this after you can create a blog post)

DONE! * A link next to each blog post that will take you to the blog post's page.
! done!
DONE! * A link to create a new blog post

* Blog page:

DONE! * Display a single blog post. Should show Title, Author, Body and creation time.


DONE! * A link to edit the blog post.
! done!

 * A link to delete the blog post.
! done!

! done! * Below the blog post, display a form that will allow a user to add a comment.


!DONE! * Below the comment form, display all comments for the given blog post.



!DONE! * Next to each comment, display a link to delete the comment.

!DONE! * Next to each comment, display a link to edit the comment.

DONE! (except for wiping form after submission- look at galvanize personnel for this info!)

 ! done!* Create Blog Page:

 * Display a form with input boxes for Title, Author, Body
! done!
 * A button to submit the creation of the blog post
! done!

* Edit Blog Page:

! done!  * Display a form with input boxes for Title, Author, Body


DONE!  * A button to submit the edit of the blog post


* Edit Comment Page

  * Display a form with input boxes for body, author

  * A button to submit the edit of the comment.

Take pictures of your mockups and check them into your repo.

## 7. Front-End

* NOTE: Your api should only be returning JSON, so you will need to make ajax requests to get the blog contents.

* NOTE: For now, you can put your HTML/CSS/JS files in the `public` folder in your app directory. Use the [express static middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express.static) to serve up the folder (This is enabled by default when using the express generator).

* Use bootstrap or another style framework of your choice. Plan ahead and use a grid system for your layout.

* Focus on creating one page at a time, focus on layout/styles and then focus on ajax requests/DOM manipulation.

* After you have finished a page, switch focus areas for the creation of the next page.

* Work efficiently.  

* Commit your code often.

## 8. Deploy to Heroku

* Create a Heroku App

* Provision a Postgres Database on your Heroku App

* Make sure you are using Environment Variables to connect to the database.

* Deploy early. Deploy often.

# Stretch Tasks

## 1. User Authentication  

> Remember that your api should only return json and should not perform any redirects. You can still create a session or set a cookie on the request and use the authentication concepts you have learned in class.

> Token-based authentication _can_ be used instead of cookies. Read up on it [here](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/token-based-authentication-with-angularjs-nodejs--cms-22543) to see if you're up for the challenge. Also take a look at the passport [jwt strategy](https://github.com/themikenicholson/passport-jwt).

* Re-factor your application to use user authentication.

* Create a users table to store your users.

* Change the author_name columns on the blog posts table and blog comments table to author_id and add a relationship to the users table.

* Restrict blog update/deletion to the author that created the blog post.

* Restrict comment deletion to the author of the post and the comment author.

* You may use passport local strategy or role your own local strategy.

## 2. Deploy to firebase

* At this point your DB and express app are hosted together on heroku

* Express is capable of serving static files, but static deployment services like firebase specialize in static content. An opinion about that [here](https://divshot.com/blog/hosting/dont-host-static-sites-on-heroku/);

* Create a separate github repo for your front end project.

* Check in your front end code.

* Update your public javascript files to make API requests to the heroku server. You will need to enable CORS in express for your firebase domain. For security, only enable cors for https://yourappname.firebaseapp.com NOT for *

* Check in your code

* Deploy your static site to firebase using the firebase cli tools.

* Remove the public folder from your heroku instance so that only the API is accessible.

## 3. Drink a beer (or other appropriate beverage)

* YOU DID IT

* YOU'RE A FULL STACK DEVELOPER

* YOU HAVE CODE RUNNING ON 2 to 3 SEPARATE SERVERS ALL COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER AND ACTUALLY WORKING

* YOU ROCK!!!!!
